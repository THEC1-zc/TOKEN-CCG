## Goal
Define the manual merge process from `codex/agent` into `main`.

## Steps
1. Review `codex/agent` diff against `main`.
2. Verify tests passed on `codex/agent`.
3. Merge manually to `main` or create a PR.
4. Deploy via Vercel for production after merge.
5. Archive the merge summary in `docs/log.md`.
